# generator-project [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ianwremmel/generator-project.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ianwremmel/generator-project)

A generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).


## Getting Started

Make sure you've install Yeoman.

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

To install generator-project from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-project
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo project
```

### generator-project

generator-project is a yeoman generator built for ianwremmel's workflow preferences. At its core, it's a very lightweight set of preferences, but overtime will expand for many of the various project types he works on.

It is unlikely to ever end up in npm.

#### Assumptions

- If you're doing anything in the frontend, you'll be using browserify.
